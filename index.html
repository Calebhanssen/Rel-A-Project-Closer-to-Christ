            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to discuss how Christ interacted with those who were broke so that we can
              understand how he will interact with us.</p>

            <h4>Overcoming Grief</h4>
            <p>
              About a year ago my father passed away hours after I came home from my mission. This caused my life to
              become chaotic. I could not have been in a better place spiritually to return; however, this was still an
              incredible challenge. Soon after, all of our friends and extended family began to serve us. We received
              meals, gift cards, notes, hugs, and so much more. What would have seemed like a small act of service to
              them were, gigantic in our eyes. How could I move forward reciprocating the love that everyone had shown
              me? </p>
            <p>I have always known how much service helps me individually, but It is always nice to have someone remind
              you of that. Due to all of the commotion, chaos, and pain that I have been through, I often push away that
              which is most important to me… my Savior, to avoid the recent memories that come with it. I know this is
              wrong. Within the last few weeks my mother has been fighting her last battle with cancer. About ten years
              ago she had breast cancer and overcame that. Now, she is working with lung cancer and a damaged liver.
              Because we have talked and read about service in class, it has reminded me of what I can do to feel better
              and show my love to the Savior. I am prepared to face that which is ahead of me. I am also confident that
              I can be a leader by teaching those around me about how genuine service can benefit everyone’s lives.
              I would say that my life has been pretty tough so far and I have always been searching for a way out. As
              I was reading through the scriptures and followed references back to Mosiah, I realized that amidst the
              trials someone is facing, if they are serving the lord with an eternal perspective, they will find true
              joy. I would like to picture Mosiah with great enthusiasm addressing his people. He was not one to stay
              quiet. This may seem like a weird connection, but I think that if I focus on serving others the pain in my
              life will decrease. I will find true joy. I will be able to grow and help others along the way as well.
              The blessings outweigh the energy drained by doing so.</p>

            <p>I was listening to a talk that my mom sent me while designing the website and his words hit me to the
              core. I am enough… I am enough in the eyes of my savior, and he will help me to become even more. It is
              okay to be broken, because we all are. All of us need him and must rely upon him to stay afloat amidst the
              trials we face during our mortality.</p>

            <h2>Scriptures and Learnings</h2>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng">
              <h5>3 Nephi 17:7</h5>
            </a>
            <p>When Christ showed himself unto the people in the Americas he took the time, because of the compassion
              he saw in them, to heal the lame, blind, leprous, and all other people who were figuratively broken. He
              could have relied upon his newly called Apostles to go about and bless those in need but he wanted to
              show His love for them. It also says in the verse that he was searching to heal those afflicted in any
              manner. I personally believe this could have included people who have depression, anxiety, etc. </p>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng">
              <h5>3 Nephi 17:9</h5>
            </a>
            <p>Following the verse that talks about asking for those who were in need of healing, this verse caught my
              attention. At the end of the verse, it says that he did heal everyone as they were brought forth to him.
              I learned that there is not any disease or affliction that He cannot help us with. He did not turn away
              those who could not see and say I am sorry but that can’t be fixed. He did not turn away those who were
              suffering with anxiety and depression and say I am sorry but that can’t be fixed either. </p>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng">
              <h5>Alma 7:10–12</h5>
            </a>
            <p>Talks about how Christ will take upon him the pains and afflictions of his people. The word pain is a
              lot broader than afflictions in my eyes. To me this helps me understand that he does not just heal those
              who are physically broken, but those who are mentally and spiritually. Also, you don’t have to be broken
              for him to heal you. It can just be slight pain.</p>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26?lang=eng">
              <h5>3 Ne. 26:15</h5>
            </a>
            <p>I think that when he healed all the sick, and their lame, and opened the eyes of the blind, it was all
              done to show forth his power and to be and example. We always talk about how Christ is a perfect example
              and I believe that he took time with the people who were suffering to show us where we should spend our
              time and efforts. </p>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/15?lang=eng">
              <h5>Alma 15:8</h5>
            </a>
            <p>If we believe in the redemption of Christ, we can be healed. I think it was a good reminder for me that
              most of his healings or miracles included a way for the person being healed to gain/show more faith. It
              talks about how we need just a particle of faith. I think it takes more faith to be healed. </p>
