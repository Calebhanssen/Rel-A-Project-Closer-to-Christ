            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to provide a safe place for me to keep my beliefs and values. Here we can write of Christ and help us remember him more and more in our every day lives. </p>

            <h4>Overcoming Grief</h4>
            <p>
              About a year ago my father passed away hours after I came home from my mission. This caused my life to
              become chaotic. I could not have been in a better place spiritually to return; however, this was still an
              incredible challenge. Soon after, all of our friends and extended family began to serve us. We received
              meals, gift cards, notes, hugs, and so much more. What would have seemed like a small act of service to
              them were, gigantic in our eyes. How could I move forward reciprocating the love that everyone had shown
              me? </p>
            <p>I have always known how much service helps me individually, but It is always nice to have someone remind
              you of that. Due to all of the commotion, chaos, and pain that I have been through, I often push away that
              which is most important to me… my Savior, to avoid the recent memories that come with it. I know this is
              wrong. Within the last few weeks my mother has been fighting her last battle with cancer. About ten years
              ago she had breast cancer and overcame that. Now, she is working with lung cancer and a damaged liver.
              Because we have talked and read about service in class, it has reminded me of what I can do to feel better
              and show my love to the Savior. I am prepared to face that which is ahead of me. I am also confident that
              I can be a leader by teaching those around me about how genuine service can benefit everyone’s lives.
              I would say that my life has been pretty tough so far and I have always been searching for a way out. As
              I was reading through the scriptures and followed references back to Mosiah, I realized that amidst the
              trials someone is facing, if they are serving the lord with an eternal perspective, they will find true
              joy. I would like to picture Mosiah with great enthusiasm addressing his people. He was not one to stay
              quiet. This may seem like a weird connection, but I think that if I focus on serving others the pain in my
              life will decrease. I will find true joy. I will be able to grow and help others along the way as well.
              The blessings outweigh the energy drained by doing so.</p>

            <p>I was listening to a talk that my mom sent me while designing the website and his words hit me to the
              core. I am enough… I am enough in the eyes of my savior, and he will help me to become even more. It is
              okay to be broken, because we all are. All of us need him and must rely upon him to stay afloat amidst the
              trials we face during our mortality.</p>

            </p>
            <h2>How can I be healed?</h2>
            <h5>Scriptures and Learnings:</h5>
              <p> Christ has been a source of strength and support for many individuals throughout their lives. For some, this support may come in the form of a community of believers, a personal relationship with God, or a sense of purpose and meaning that comes from following Christ's teachings.
                In times of difficulty, turning to Christ can provide comfort and hope. Many individuals have found solace in prayer and meditation, and have felt a sense of peace and calm in the midst of challenging circumstances.
                Christ can also provide guidance and direction, helping individuals navigate life's many challenges and uncertainties. By following Christ's example and teachings, individuals can find a sense of purpose and direction in their lives, and can make decisions that are in line with their values and beliefs.
                Overall, Christ can offer a profound sense of support and guidance to those who seek it. By cultivating a relationship with Christ and following his teachings, individuals can find strength, comfort, and direction in all aspects of their lives.

            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng">
              <h5>3 Nephi 17:7</h5>
            </a>
            <p>When Christ showed himself unto the people in the Americas he took the time, because of the compassion
              he saw in them, to heal the lame, blind, leprous, and all other people who were figuratively broken. He
              could have relied upon his newly called Apostles to go about and bless those in need but he wanted to
              show His love for them. It also says in the verse that he was searching to heal those afflicted in any
              manner. I personally believe this could have included people who have depression, anxiety, etc. </p>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng">
              <h5>3 Nephi 17:9</h5>
            </a>
            <p>Following the verse that talks about asking for those who were in need of healing, this verse caught my
              attention. At the end of the verse, it says that he did heal everyone as they were brought forth to him.
              I learned that there is not any disease or affliction that He cannot help us with. He did not turn away
              those who could not see and say I am sorry but that can’t be fixed. He did not turn away those who were
              suffering with anxiety and depression and say I am sorry but that can’t be fixed either. </p>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng">
              <h5>Alma 7:10–12</h5>
            </a>
            <p>Talks about how Christ will take upon him the pains and afflictions of his people. The word pain is a
              lot broader than afflictions in my eyes. To me this helps me understand that he does not just heal those
              who are physically broken, but those who are mentally and spiritually. Also, you don’t have to be broken
              for him to heal you. It can just be slight pain.</p>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26?lang=eng">
              <h5>3 Ne. 26:15</h5>
            </a>
            <p>I think that when he healed all the sick, and their lame, and opened the eyes of the blind, it was all
              done to show forth his power and to be and example. We always talk about how Christ is a perfect example
              and I believe that he took time with the people who were suffering to show us where we should spend our
              time and efforts. </p>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/15?lang=eng">
              <h5>Alma 15:8</h5>
            </a>
            <p>If we believe in the redemption of Christ, we can be healed. I think it was a good reminder for me that
              most of his healings or miracles included a way for the person being healed to gain/show more faith. It
              talks about how we need just a particle of faith. I think it takes more faith to be healed. </p>

              <h2>How to Overcome Grief</h2>
              <p>Grief is a natural response to loss, and it can be a difficult and painful process to navigate. Turning
                 to Christ can offer comfort and support during this challenging time. Here are some ways to overcome grief through Christ:
                <br><br> 1. Seek comfort in prayer: Prayer can be a powerful tool for finding comfort and peace during times of grief. By 
                praying and talking to God, you can express your feelings and emotions, and find solace in knowing that Christ is with you and understands your pain.
                <br><br> 2. Find strength in scripture: The Bible offers many passages that can provide comfort and guidance during times of grief. 
                Reading and meditating on scripture can help you find strength, hope, and comfort in Christ's teachings.
                <br><br> 3. Connect with others: The support of a community of believers can be invaluable during times of grief.
                 Connecting with others who have experienced loss can offer a sense of solidarity and understanding, and can provide a safe space for sharing your feelings and emotions.
                <br><br> 4. Embrace Christ's love: Christ's love is unconditional, and it can offer a source of comfort and strength 
                during times of grief. By embracing Christ's love and teachings, you can find solace in knowing that you are not alone, and that Christ is with you every step of the way.
                <br><br> 5. Serve others: Serving others can be a meaningful way to honor the memory of your loved one, and can also offer 
                a sense of purpose and fulfillment during times of grief. By focusing on the needs of others, you can find meaning and joy in helping others, 
                and can also find healing and comfort in Christ's teachings on service and compassion.
                <br><br>
                Remember that the process of overcoming grief is a journey, and it can take time and patience. Turning to Christ can offer comfort and support along the way, and can help you find meaning and purpose in the midst of your pain.</p>
