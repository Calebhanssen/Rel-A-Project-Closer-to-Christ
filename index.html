            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to discuss how Christ interacted with those who were broke so that we can
              understand how he will interact with us.</p>

            <h4>Overcoming Grief</h4>
            <p>A few years ago, I came home 3 weeks early from my mission to see my dad for one day before he passed
              away. That was really hard on me. I never was mad at God. I have a decent understanding of the gospel and
              I know that I will see him again but the pain it brought caused me to develop severe anxiety and
              depression. The best way to explain it is that because his death was so closely attached to my service in
              the church, I have sense then avoided service to stay away from ever having to feel what I felt then. I
              love the church and have a testimony, but it was hard for me to stay strong when I was trying to avoid it.
              I was listening to a talk that my mom sent me while designing the website and his words hit me to the
              core. I am enough… I am enough in the eyes of my savior, and he will help me to become even more. It is
              okay to be broken, because we all are. All of us need him and must rely upon him to stay afloat amidst the
              trials we face during our mortality.</p>

            <h2>Scriptures and Learnings</h2>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng">
              <h5>3 Nephi 17:7</h5>
            </a>
            <p>When Christ showed himself unto the people in the Americas he took the time, because of the compassion
              he saw in them, to heal the lame, blind, leprous, and all other people who were figuratively broken. He
              could have relied upon his newly called Apostles to go about and bless those in need but he wanted to
              show His love for them. It also says in the verse that he was searching to heal those afflicted in any
              manner. I personally believe this could have included people who have depression, anxiety, etc. </p>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng">
              <h5>3 Nephi 17:9</h5>
            </a>
            <p>Following the verse that talks about asking for those who were in need of healing, this verse caught my
              attention. At the end of the verse, it says that he did heal everyone as they were brought forth to him.
              I learned that there is not any disease or affliction that He cannot help us with. He did not turn away
              those who could not see and say I am sorry but that can’t be fixed. He did not turn away those who were
              suffering with anxiety and depression and say I am sorry but that can’t be fixed either. </p>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng">
              <h5>Alma 7:10–12</h5>
            </a>
            <p>Talks about how Christ will take upon him the pains and afflictions of his people. The word pain is a
              lot broader than afflictions in my eyes. To me this helps me understand that he does not just heal those
              who are physically broken, but those who are mentally and spiritually. Also, you don’t have to be broken
              for him to heal you. It can just be slight pain.</p>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26?lang=eng">
              <h5>3 Ne. 26:15</h5>
            </a>
            <p>I think that when he healed all the sick, and their lame, and opened the eyes of the blind, it was all
              done to show forth his power and to be and example. We always talk about how Christ is a perfect example
              and I believe that he took time with the people who were suffering to show us where we should spend our
              time and efforts. </p>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/15?lang=eng">
              <h5>Alma 15:8</h5>
            </a>
            <p>If we believe in the redemption of Christ, we can be healed. I think it was a good reminder for me that
              most of his healings or miracles included a way for the person being healed to gain/show more faith. It
              talks about how we need just a particle of faith. I think it takes more faith to be healed. </p>
